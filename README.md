As part of my cybersecurity thesis I wanted to create an exploit for a vulnerability.

I HIGHLY recommend reading this guide, as this exploit is based on it:

This code is by no means perfect, sometimes it gets a bit buggy if you set a password for the new user.

I recommend NOT setting a password.

If it does not create a new user, simply retry a few times and it will eventually work.
